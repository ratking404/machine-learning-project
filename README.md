Ben (Benedict Sau)** – Diploma Level, Programming for AI

 Project Description

This project demonstrates how to build a **simple Machine Learning model** using Python and scikit-learn, one of the most widely used ML libraries. The project focuses on implementing two possible model types:

* Linear Regression (for predicting continuous values), or
* Decision Tree Classifier (for predicting categories).

The project includes all essential ML steps:

1. Loading a Dataset
2. Preprocessing Data (optional depending on dataset)
3. Training the Model
4. Making Predictions
5. Evaluating the Model
6. Saving the Model for Future Use

 Project Objectives

* Learn how to prepare data for machine learning.
* Understand and implement a supervised ML model in Python.
* Demonstrate correct usage of scikit-learn.
* Show ability to interpret ML evaluation results.
* Write clean, modular, and documented Python code.


 What the Project Involves (Requirements)

Your project should include:

 ✔ 1. **Data Loading**

Use either scikit-learn's built-in datasets (Diabetes, Iris, etc.) or your own dataset.

 ✔ 2. **Model Building**

Choose **ONE** of the following:

* **Linear Regression** – for predicting a numeric value.
* **Decision Tree Classifier** – for classifying items into categories.

✔ 3. **Model Training**

Split your data into training and testing sets.
Train the model using the training data.

✔ 4. **Prediction**

Use the trained model to make predictions on test data or sample inputs.

 ✔ 5. **Evaluation**

Depending on your model:

* Regression → **MSE**, **R² score**
* Classification → **Accuracy**, **Classification report**, **Confusion matrix**

 ✔ 6. **Output & Interpretation**

Explain what the results mean (e.g., "High accuracy means the model predicts flower types correctly.").

 ✔ 7. **Use of ML Libraries**

The project must use:

* scikit-learn
* numpy
* pandas
* matplotlib (optional for charts)
* joblib (optional for saving model)

 ✔ 8. **Modularity & Readability**

Your code should have:

* Functions (e.g., load_data, build_model, train_model)
* Clear variable names
* Comments explaining key steps
